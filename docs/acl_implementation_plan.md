# ACL Implementation Plan for ZooKeeper Nodes

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing Access Control Lists (ACL) for ZooKeeper nodes in ClickHouse.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Identify Node Creation Points**
   - Search through the `src` directory for any interactions with ZooKeeper.
   - Locate all the points in the codebase where ZooKeeper nodes are created.

2. **Define ACL Rules**
   - Establish a standard set of ACL rules to be applied to every node.
   - Ensure these rules are configurable to allow flexibility based on security requirements.

3. **Modify Node Creation Logic**
   - Update the logic at each node creation point to include the application of the defined ACL rules.
   - Modify existing functions or create new utility functions to handle ACL application.

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit and integration tests to ensure ACLs are correctly applied to all nodes upon creation.
   - Create test cases that verify the presence and correctness of ACLs on newly created nodes.

5. **Documentation**
   - Update the documentation to reflect the new feature, including any configuration options for ACL rules.
